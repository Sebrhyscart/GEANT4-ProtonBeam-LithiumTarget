# Proton beam accelerator in to Lithium target GEANT4
Simulation based on an experiment performed at the McMaster Tandetron Accelerator.

This simulation is part one of a new lab for the courese ENGPHYS 4PP3: Applications of Plasma Physics offered at McMaster University. The purpose of this lab is to determine the Li7(p,n)Be7 cross section. This is done by shooting a proton beam at a Lithium target, and determining the number of time this nuclear reaction occurs.

This simulation is written in C++ for the Monte Carlo particle trasport code GEANT4, developed at CERN.
