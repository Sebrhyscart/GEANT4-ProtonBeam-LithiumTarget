# Proton beam accelerator in to Lithium target GEANT4
Simulation based on an experiment performed at the McMaster Tandetron Accelerator

The simulation is Part One of a new lab for the course ENGPHYS 4PP3: Applications of Plasma Physics. The purpose of the lab and simulation is to experimentally
determine the neutron production cross section for the Proton - Lithium nuclear reaction.

The simulation is written in C++ for the Monte Carlo particle transport code GEANT4, developed by CERN. The simulation creates several output.csv files, which 
must be read by the file xsCalculator.py
